        <meetingContent><![CDATA[<p class="flow-text"><em>Due to unforeseeable problems, we have had to cancel the Amazon Alexa talk by David Low, and are replacing it with another talk about Node JS in the Cloud. We are looking to reschedule the Amazon Alexa talk for January.</em></p>
<p class="flow-text">During this session we will aim to build a server-less RESTful API based upon Amazon's AWS cloud technologies.</p>
<p class="flow-text">This is intended as a high-level hands-on session, where you can get exposure to a wide number of intersecting technologies, giving us the opportunity to do a deep dive on each individual component in future sessions.</p>
<p class="flow-text">In this session we will use: Node JS, Lambda, API Gateway, IAM Security &amp; Document DB.</p>
<p class="flow-text">These will be included into a Blue Peter style "here's one I made earlier" React Website to show off the capabilities.</p>
<p class="flow-text">If you are planning on joining in then please<span> </span><a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup">register for an Amazon AWS account</a>BEFORE the event. Amazon offer a 12 month free tier which will cover your needs, but you will need to supply payment details.</p>]]></meetingContent>

In 2016 Dave helped write Hackbot and the Hack24-API for use at various hack events, and spends his free time dabbling in many unfinished projects. He is an advocate for TypeScript, prefers to avoid .NET (at last), and recently converted to veganism to help save the world from self destruction.]]></bio>

        <meetingContent><![CDATA[<p class="flow-text">Many of us know about the benefits of offloading concurrent I/O operations through the use of callbacks, libraries such as async and bluebird, or using the new Promise support in browsers and Node.js. But, do you know how these work, and when you should use them?</p>
<p class="flow-text">In this talk we will review the benefits, pitfalls, and ways to implement concurrent JavaScript code in Node.js and the browser. We'll look at the support for<span> </span>async/await, how this differs from callbacks and asynchronous libraries, and take a brief look at how these have been implemented to gain a better understanding of what's going on under the hood.</p>
<p class="flow-text">At the end of this talk you will be able to make more informed decisions about the use of synchronous API methods such as readFileSync, choosing to listen to error events, and why wrapping function calls in<span> </span>try..catch<span> </span>may or may not be useful.</p>]]></meetingContent>
